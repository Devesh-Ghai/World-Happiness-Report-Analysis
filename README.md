## Dashboard Link : https://world-happiness-report-analysis-for-the-years-2015-to-2019-cbf.streamlit.app

## Overview
This project is a data visualization and analytics dashboard that explores global happiness and economic trends. It utilizes the **World Happiness Report** dataset to derive insights for governments, NGOs, and researchers. The dashboard is built using **Streamlit**, offering interactive visualizations and intuitive filters for exploration.

## Features
### Streamlit Dashboard
1. **ðŸŒŸ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Average Happiness Score
   - Country with the Highest GDP
   - Average Life Expectancy
   - Number of Countries in the Dataset

2. **ðŸ¥‡ Top 10 Happiest Countries:**
   - Interactive horizontal bar charts using Plotly.

3. **ðŸ”— Correlation Heatmap:**
   - Explore relationships between factors like GDP, Social Support, and Life Expectancy.

4. **ðŸ’° GDP vs Happiness Score:**
   - Scatter plot showcasing the relationship between economic strength and well-being.

5. **ðŸŽ¯ Insights & Recommendations:**
   - Recommendations for governments and NGOs based on trends and correlations.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Removed irrelevant columns such as "Lower Whisker," "Upper Whisker," and "Lower Interval."
- Combined datasets from 2015 to 2019 into a unified DataFrame.
- Filled null values with default values for seamless analysis.
- Exported cleaned dataset as `World_happiness_report.csv`.

## Data Cleaning
The project involves the integration of five datasets (2015-2019). Key steps:
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Dropped irrelevant columns.
- Merged datasets into one comprehensive file with an additional `Year` column.
- Identified and filled null values.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality.

Key visualizations during data cleaning:
- Distribution of Happiness Scores.
- Average Happiness Score by Year.
- Correlation between Happiness and factors like GDP, Life Expectancy, and Social Support.

## Visualizations
### Key Insights:
1. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - Histogram to analyze the spread of happiness scores.

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Bar plots showing the average happiness score by year.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Heatmaps to reveal relationships between factors.

4. **Country-Specific Insights:**
   - Top 10 happiest countries each year.
   - Countries with low life expectancy or social support.

5. **Recommendations:**
   - Identified high-GDP, low-happiness countries to address policy gaps.
